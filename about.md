### About me!

I'm a System Engineer from Medellín, Colombia, I love everything related to software development, new technologies, design and software architecture, I have worked for more than 10 years into this passionate world where I have been involved as a developer, technical leader and software architect. So I just want to share my experience and of course learn more, because teaching is the best way to learn!

>I Love C#, DDD, CQRS, Microservices…and the music as well.
