### About me!

I'm a System Engineer from Medellín, Colombia, I'm passionate to software development and new technologies, methodologies and everything about design and software architecture, I have 10 years’ experience into this exciting world where I have worked like developer, technical leader and software architect. So I just want to share my experience and of course learn more, because teaching is the best way to learn!

>I Love C#, DDD, CQRS, Microservices…and the music as well.
